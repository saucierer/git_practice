Hello Git and GitHub

These are additions I'm adding to determine how to commit this back to the repo on my computer.

To update the changes made in the GitHub browser interface, use "git pull" and the the changes will show up in the computer / CLI repo.

And then to send changes to GH, use "git push" in the terminal. For future reference, "terminal" and "cli" refer to the computer, terminal-based side of things.  "GH" and "github" refer to the web-based github interface.

I've changed my global email addy and I want to make sure I can still push things to gh...
